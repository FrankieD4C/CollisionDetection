# ME759 Final Project: Collision Detection

A simple description of milestone 2

## Progress

* Successfully loaded & converted meshfile and spherefile

* Successfully implemented algorithm for sphere-triangle collision detection, accomplished a brute-force solution

* Successfully implemented Hammad and Danâ€™s algorithm, a broad-phase collision detection step in order to spatially group spheres and triangles into bins

* Created & passed several simple testcase

* Passed official testcase

## Problems

* More parallelized?

* Apply shared memory?


## Todo

* Scaling analysis

* Final report
